# pong-rs

A crappy attempt at a Rust implementation of Pong using ggez, with a neural net-powered AI player.

Inspiration for Pong code based heavily on [this tutorial](https://mkhan45.github.io/2020/05/19/Pong-tutorial-with-ggez.html), and neural net + genetic algorithm code based heavily on [this tutorial](https://pwy.io/en/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/).
